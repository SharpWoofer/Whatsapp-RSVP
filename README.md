## About

This is a RSVP bot for Whatsapp. It is able to record groups of people (and their attendees' number of pax) arriving to a particular event invited by the host. 
It makes it easier for the host to view at a glance:
- Each attendee's name along with number of pax
- Total number of pax

## How to use
Firstly, the host must link their Whatsapp account to the bot.
- '!start' gives an overview of instructions.
- '!add Name Number' allows an attendee to add their name along with number of pax. Subsequent number changes to the same name will reflect the new value.
- '!add Name 0' removes the attendee fromn the list.
- '!list' prints the list that shows each attendee's name along with number of pax, and the total number of pax.
- '!wordle GUESS' allows anyone to play a game of wordle, my original whatsapp chatbot function.
